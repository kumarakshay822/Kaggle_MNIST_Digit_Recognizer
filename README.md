# Kaggle_MNIST_Digit_Recognizer

This is the code for a model which recognizes digits and is trained on the MNIST Dataset. My model is written using  only Numpy and Python. The model achieves an accuracy of 78.7%. This can probably  be improved by a lot by training the model for a longer period of time.
